1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This study replicates the methodology from "A Hybrid Deep Learning Based Model 
for Volatility Prediction" (Indian metals) and applies it to US financial indices
(SPX, NDX, RTY). The results reveal a COMPLETE RANKING REVERSAL, providing the
first empirical evidence that optimal model complexity is market-dependent.

KEY FINDING: Simple models (Single GARCH-LSTM) outperform complex models 
(Triple GARCH-LSTM) in efficient markets, while the opposite holds for 
less efficient markets.

12. CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

This study provides the first empirical evidence that optimal model complexity
in volatility forecasting is market-dependent. The complete ranking reversal
between Indian metals and US financial indices demonstrates that:

1. EFFICIENT MARKETS favor SIMPLE models (Single GARCH-LSTM)
2. LESS EFFICIENT MARKETS favor COMPLEX models (Triple GARCH-LSTM)  
3. Market structure characteristics predict optimal complexity
4. The effect is large, robust, and economically significant

This finding has profound implications for both academic research and industry 
practice, establishing market-dependent model selection as a fundamental 
principle in financial machine learning.

The research bridges machine learning methodology with market microstructure
theory, providing a theoretical framework for understanding when and why
different levels of model complexity are optimal.

RESEARCH IMPACT: This work challenges the assumption of universal model 
rankings and establishes market efficiency as a key determinant of optimal
forecasting model complexity.
